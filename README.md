Discrete Event Simulation and Random Number Generators (Fibonacci Sequence)

Communication Networks: Theory
Homework Assignment 3
Discrete Event Simulation and Random Number Generators - this is a sample of the implementation of linear congruential RNGs and Lagged Fibonacci RNGs. And also combining
them into something we call a Mixed LBG (Mixed Linear Fibonacci Generator). 

A Chi-Square Test is also used to test the porgram given a pre-determined confidence level.
